	<h1> Static positioning </h1>
	<p> Positions are static by default. Static is the default position for 	elements being laid out. </p>

	<h1> Relative Positioning</h1>

	<p> Setting the position to relative by itself does not actually do anything. 	You must chose one or two of the following positions: Top, bottom, left, 	right. This way, you are setting the position <i>relative</i> to something. 	</p>
	
	<p> Since you are setting positions relative to their original positions, 	they appear a certain distance from where they would have gone before. 		Relative positioning holds the elements original place in the layout.</p>

	<p> How do you get rid of the space where elements would have been if it were 	not for relative positioning? You don't, keep that in mind.</p>

	<h1> Fixed vs Sticky</h1>
	
	<p>Fixed is a possible position setting, which brings the element into its 	own separate dimension of positions. </p>

	<p> Sticky. It sticks. It gets stuck to the screen.</p>
