    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>Despite Native American communities having high rates of childhood
      suicide and psychiatric disorders in comparison to the rest of America,
      they face a deficiency in behavioral and mental health treatment
      opportunities. For this reason, the NAU CANIS Lab has been developing
      ARORA, a behavioral health application designed to help Native American
      youths develop emotional resilience and healthy coping skills for stress
      and general mental illness. In order to ensure that the features within
      ARORA can be successful among its users, I have conducted a literary
      analysis of previous studies on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) regarding
       behavioral health and analyzed the data found in our focus groups. We have
       found from the results of our focus groups that several of the activities
       in ARORA are effective in reducing stress and anxiety among its users.
       Several members of our focus groups have also expressed that the app
       should be more centered around Native American culture, as it currently
       does not appear to be directed towards their demographic. These
       participants gave many suggestions for how their culture could be
       integrated into ARORA.</p>
    <h3>Methods</h3>
      <p>In order to design ARORA, our team used community participatory design.
      This entailed creating a community advisory board, consisting of members of
      the Native American community. The community advirsory board gave our team
      insight and advice on how to successfully create an mHealth app for
      Native American adolescents.
      Another approach we used for this project is grounded theory, which
      entails developing a theory based on evidence and data obtained from
      comparative analysis.</p>
      <br>
      <p>ARORA, our mobile application was developed in Android Studio. Its
      effectiveness was measured through several user testing studies, in which
      Native American adolescents would practice using the app and give their
      feedback. During these testing sessions, we recorded facilitated
      discussions in which participants explained whether or not they thought
      app was effective and gave suggestions for improvements. The recordings from
      these sessions were then transcribed and analyzed through NVIVO.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>We also conducted a literary analysis, in which previous research
        projects regarding behavioral health mHealth applications for adolescents
        and young adults were analyzed.
