    <p>1. Monique
      <img src="Monique.png" alt="Monique">
      <br>
      <p>Many Animal crossing fans do not like Monique because of her
      beauty mark and the fact that she's a snooty type villager, but
      many people fail to realize that her character
      design is actually meant as a tribute to Andy Warhol's
      paintings of Marilyn Monroe. Her hair, eyes, and beauty mark are
      meant to resemble Marilyn Monroe's complection, and the color
      schemes of her outfits and home correspond with the colors used
      in Warhol's famous painting. This is my second favorite Villager
      based on a real person, next to that one flamingo character who's
      based off of a grandmother who clocked 100+ hours into
      Animal Crossing: Wild World when playing with her grandkids.</p>
      <br>
      2. Klaus
      <img src="Klaus.png" alt="Klaus">
      <br>
      <p> Klaus is a really interesting character because his design
        is based off of ancient Rome and gladiators. While this Villager
        has a stern personality type, he always gives players the best gifts.
        I rate this villager at a solid 8/10. He is not necessarilly the
        cutest character in the franchise, but he certainly will not be
        evicted if he moves to my island.</p>
      <br>
      3. Camofrog
      <img src="Camofrog.png" alt="Camofrog">
      <br>
      <p>While Camofrog undoubtedly has the most unoriginal name in the
      entire game, it's hard not to fall in love with the adorable design
      of this character. His "lazy" personality makes him one of the sweetest
      characters so his personality makes up for the lack of uniqueness in
      his name. He's a great villager and he knows it, which is seen through
      his default outfit: A shirt that says "MVP," or "Most Valuable Player."
      Now that I think about it, he may actually be athletic-type and not
      lazy-type, but either way he's a super fun villager.</p>

  <addendum>
    <p>For this project, I chose to set up the layout of my page with
    grid-template areas. I liked using this way of arranging the layout
    because it was easier to visualize what the page would look like.
    Then, I just set each class's grid-area value to whatever was representing
    them in grid-template-areas.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The hardest part of this assignment for me was making the links in the
      leftmost collumn of the page appear vertically and not horizontally.
      In order to fix this issue, I created a subclass for the links called
      "nav_link," where I used display, flex-direction, and vertical-align to
      modify their appearance as needed. </p>
