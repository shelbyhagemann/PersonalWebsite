    <h1>Addendum</h1>
    <p> For this assignment I decided to make a pythagorean theorem calculator.
      <br>
      I have a function, "pyth," which takes in the values of the two legs in <thead>
        triangle. Then, it uses the pythagorean theorem, squaring the two input values,
        adding them, and taking the square root, to find the length of the hypotenuse.
