<div id="test">

	In order to serve this font, I first went to google's collection of free fronts,
	https://fonts.google.com. Once I found a font that I liked, I downloaded a .ttf 	file containing its information and saved it to the same folder that my stylesheet
	and html document are in. Then, in my CSS folder, I used the following tag:
<b>
	@font-face
</b>

	Under there, I set font-family to the name of the font that I chose (Akronim),
	and the source to url(Akronim-Regular.ttf) format("truetype"), which is the name 
	of the .ttf file I downloaded followed by the type of file it is.
