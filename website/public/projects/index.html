		<h3> Project for CS 386: Software Engineering </h3>
		<p> In the Summer of 2020, I took a course on Software Engineering at NAU. This
			class taught me many important skills for working in Computer Science, such
			as AGILE development methods. </p>
		<p> I worked in a group with a few other students to create a mobile app called
			"Journal Time." We developed this app using Dart and Flutter, Incorporating
			various APIs, such as the Google Maps API. To learn more about our project,
			please see our <a href = "https://github.com/CS386-journal-time/CS386-journal-time"> GitHub repository.</a> </p>

		<h3> Personal Projects</h3>
		<p> I find web programming very fun and interesting, so in my free time I try
			 to teach myself how to create different types of projects using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
			 The project below is a dress-up game, that I am still working on creating. It is currently
			  not fully functional, as it is still a work-in-progress. I am hoping to fix my current errors
				 and make this project usable over Christmas break, when I have more freetime.</p>

		<h3> App Development for the ARORA Project </h3>
		<p> Since 2019, I have worked with NAU's CANIS Lab on the ARORA Project. This
			project entails developing a behavioral health-focued app for American Indigenious youths.
			 I have done research, writing, and app development for this project. To see
			 what our app currently looks like, please see our <a href =

		<h3> Undergraduate Research Symposium 2020 </h3>
		<p> In 2020, I presented on the research findings of the ARORA Project at NAU's
			Undergraduate Research Symposium. You can view a webpage that I designed summarizing
			our results <a href="symposium/index.html"> here.</a></p>
